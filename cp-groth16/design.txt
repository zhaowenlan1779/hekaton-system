We use committed inputs to commit to the trace before hashing it and getting the SZ challenge

What ends up being a public input:
The challenge
The running evals (bc they're derived from the challenge)
The state (or not; it can be public input bc it's a deterministic function of the committed inputs)

We should do committed input/output. It's both faster and more succinct

Everything will be committed. Even chal. We will check chal at the end of computation by opening
the initial and final commitments, which contain chal as the 0-th elem in the attribute set.

Pre-challenge and post-challenge vars
Pre: trace
Post: cpu state, chal

Prechallenge constraint system:
do some allocation (input)
have some constraints
pass this into function f

Compute chal from all commitments

Postchallenge constraint system #1:
Input chal
Input in CPU state

Postchallenge constraint system #2:
Input chal (yes, repeated because we need to have the same structure as post system #1)
Input out CPU state

With these 3 constraint systems, we can now do the Commit SRS setup for CP-Groth16

Postchallenge constraint system #3:
Run TranscriptCheckerCircuit, taking as input all the vars that have been allocated so far
    So ALL vars must be in this CS and consistent
    Prechallenge cs -> post #1 -> post #2 -> post #3
